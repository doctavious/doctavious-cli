// changelog + tag + bump
// lets look at other systems but I think I like mavens where you tag first then bump
// so a release of x.x.x-prerelease|snapshot+build_mod would drop prerelease|snapshot to tag then bump
// and potentially add a prelease|snapshot.
// see what semver mentions.

// build_mod could be a number, git hash, timestmap
